The data about bank transactions consists of a sequence of transactions: the information of each transaction has the following format:
<from_account>   <to_account>   <money>   <time_point>   <atm>
In which:
•	<from_account>: the account from which money is transferred (which is a string of length from 6 to 20 )
•	<to_account>: the account which receives money in the transaction (which is a string of length from 6 to 20)
•	<money>: amount of money transferred in the transaction (which is an integer from 1 to 10000)
•	<time_point>: the time point at which the transaction is performed, it is a string under the format HH:MM:SS  (hour: minute: second)
•	<atm>: the code of the ATM where the transaction is taken (a string of length from 3 to 10)
Example: T00112233445 T001234002 2000 08:36:25 BIDV (at the ATM BIDV, account T00112233445 transfers 2000$ to account T001234002 at time point 08:36:25 (08 hour, 36 minutes, 25 seconds) 
Write a program that process following queries: 
•	?count_total_transactions: compute the total number of transactions of the data
•	?count_total_money: compute the total amount of money of transactions  
•	?list_sorted_account: compute the sequence of bank accounts (including sending and receiving accounts) appearing in the transaction (sorted in an increasing (alphabetical) order)  
•	?amount_money_trans_from <account>: compute the total amount of money transferred from the account <account>  
Input (stdin)
The input consists of 2 blocks of information: the data block and the query block
•	The data block consists lines
o	Each line contains the information about a transaction described above
o	The data is terminated by a line containing #
•	The query block consists of lines:
o	Each line is a query described above
o	The query block is terminated by a line containing #

Output (stdout)
•	Print to stdout (in each line) the result of each query described above
